Day-Two-Poem
============
The Big Bang began the cosmos birth
And from this came the molten Earth

The years went by
Time really did fly

Not long after walked the mighty dinosaur
And deafened the Earth with its mighty roar

The age of dinosaurs came and went
And modern man began its ascent

In the beginning we respected each other
Now our favorite comeback is... your mother


I-am-poem
=========
I am smart and thoughtful

I wonder how we got here

I hear the universe calling my name

I see it reaching towards me with great cosmic arms

I want to know why we're here

I am smart and thoughtful

I pretend to know why we're here

I feel like we can't be the only ones

I touch lives around me

I worry about our future

I cry when I realize I too will come to pass

I am smart and thoutful

I understand everything, yet nothing

I say we are just one speck of dust on a cosmic scale

I dream about the future

I try to understand

I hope we realize our mistakes

I am smart and thoughtful
